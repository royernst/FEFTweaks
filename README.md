# FEFTweaks

A save editor for Fire Emblem Fates

What this does:
* Opens a "chapter" save
* Shows a few things
* Lets you apply some cheats or make some changes
* Lets you save changes to the file you opened

How to use:
* Backup your save. You'll need homebrew and svdt or some other save manager. Also if you're on the digital version, you need CFW I think because of newer save encryption.
* Copy your save to your computer.
* MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVE IN CASE ANYTHING GOES WRONG.
* (Optionally) Decompress it using FEST, available here: https://github.com/RainThunder/FEST
* File > Open
* Click cheat buttons
* File > Save
* Restore the save

Have fun, and I guess report problems? I don't know how much I'll add to this...
